**`Software engeneering`**

I'm a software engeneering student that likes to challenge himself
to produce the best possible outcome. I like to learn and ocasionally
like to do some niche projects so I can be prepared to thinking outside
the box. There'll be a lot of repositories with school work, so majority 
of the projects will be built from that prepective. I have all my socials [here]
