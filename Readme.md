## ✨About Me

<details>
    <summary><b>👽 Bio</b></summary>
    <br/>
        I'm a software engeneering student that likes to challenge himself to produce the best possible outcome. I like to learn and ocasionally like to do some niche projects so I can be prepared to thinking outside the box.
        I'm getting more and more used to programming and liking the process of learning it.
        My first contact with programming was in 2018, still in high school, where I programmed in Visual Basic for school work, I was stunned by what you actually could do with that and became fascinated.
        Going to college, I started by choosing Software Engeneering at Universidade de Coimbra, my second option, as going to Software Engeneering at Universidade do Minho was my first. I was alone in a different city living alone and it was overall a bad experience for me, in the middle of those bad things, there was something good, and it was my involvement with *python*, I really loved the range of things it let me work with, but the most impactful thing that I learnt there was turtle.py, I really liked that chapter.
        After an year in Coimbra, I asked a transfer to Minho, that was successful, and after that and until today, I am learning and gaining some skills in other languages, such as *haskell* and *c* that I continue to develop.
        There'll be a lot of repositories with school work, so majority of the repositories will be built from that prepective.
        I need to add "looking forward to learn languages" tab.
